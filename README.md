twitter_like_app
================

Create a simple twitter like application that allows a user to tweet(limit to 160 characters), retweet other people tweets and follow people. Just a bare bone application with no multimedia (image) uploads. Make sure you create a unique user name for each user. At the time of signup so that his profile can be visited by app.com/user_name. Tweets will be private and public. Private tweets can only be re-tweeted by the user's followers. But public tweets can be retweeted by any registered user.. Also include Unit and Functional test cases.
